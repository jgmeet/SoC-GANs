# Enhance low resolution image using GANs

Welcome to my ESRGAN Image Enhancement Project! This repository showcases my implementation of the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) using PyTorch to enhance low-resolution images with significant loss of details, transforming them into high-resolution images with remarkable spatial resolution.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to implement ESRGAN using PyTorch and explore its potential in enhancing low-resolution images. I followed the research paper titled "[ESRGAN: Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219)" as a foundation for building the architecture. Additionally, I learned about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PyTorch to strengthen my understanding of the underlying concepts.

## Timeline

To successfully complete this project, I relied on my intermediate Python skills and my enthusiasm to learn about Deep Learning and Neural Networks. Here's a summary of the timeline and key tasks I accomplished:

### Week 1

- Reviewed Python Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

### Week 2

- Got acquainted with Neural Networks and the mathematical foundations behind them.
- Explored older implementations of neural networks in Python.

### Week 3

- Familiarized myself with PyTorch, particularly the `nn.Module` class.
- Implemented a basic classification model using Logistic Regression on the iris dataset in PyTorch.

### Week 4

- Understood Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Implemented a basic classification model on the MNIST digits dataset in PyTorch.

### Week 5

- Carefully read and understood the ESRGAN paper to grasp its methods and contributions.

### Week 6-7

- Started implementing the ESRGAN model following the architecture mentioned in the paper.
- Completed the ESRGAN implementation and performed debugging to ensure smooth functioning.
